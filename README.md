Understanding the XOR Function

The XOR (exclusive OR) problem is a foundational example in machine learning, particularly neural networks, that demonstrates 
the limitations of single-layer perceptrons and the power of multi-layer networks.

Limitations of Single-Layer Perceptrons

Linear Separability: Single-layer perceptrons can only solve problems where the data points can be separated by a straight line.
The XOR problem is inherently non-linear; there's no single straight line that can divide the true 
and false outputs.

The Power of Multi-Layer Neural Networks

Multi-layer neural networks, particularly with hidden layers, can learn complex non-linear relationships. The hidden layers can extract new, meaningful features from the input data, effectively transforming the problem into a linearly separable space. The network adjusts its weights and biases to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs with the backpropagation algorithm.

Solving XOR with a Multi-Layer Neural Network

Typically, a two-layer network with a hidden layer is sufficient for XOR. Non-linear activation functions like sigmoid or ReLU are essential for capturing non-linear relationships. The network is trained using backpropagation to adjust its weights and biases. The hidden layer learns to create internal representations that transform the input space into a linearly separable one.

Geometric Interpretation

The original input space for XOR is not linearly separable. The hidden layer effectively "bends" or "twists" the input space, making the problem linearly separable in the transformed space.

Key Points

The XOR problem highlights the limitations of single-layer perceptrons and the power of multi-layer networks. Multi-layer networks can learn complex non-linear relationships through hidden layers and non-linear activation functions. Backpropagation is a crucial algorithm for training neural networks. The hidden layer plays a vital role in transforming the input space to make the problem solvable. By understanding the XOR problem and its solution, you gain insights into the fundamental principles of neural networks and their ability to tackle complex, real-world problems.
